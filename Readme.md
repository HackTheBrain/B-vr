# B-vr

This is the project B-vr[biːvə(r)] - a short for Brain VR. Project B-vr is an abstract audiovisual art form with a goal to create a cerebral virtual reality visual music instrument. And a lots of pyramids.

# Overview
B-vr is a visual scene portable to VR which is driven by the eeg signal provided by the EMOTIVE eeg. We use its gyroscope to drivethe view on flat screens projections. 

The scenes visuals and sounds are matched to alfa, beta and theta power as well as trained parameters from the OpenViBE . Result is an abstract audiovisual experience which you can shape to your liking with your mind only!
