Project B-vr [biːvə(r)] - short for Brain VR - is an abstract audiovisual art form with a goal to create a cerebral virtual reality visual music instrument. And a lots of pyramids.

B-vr is a visual scene portable to VR driven by the EEG signal provided by the EMOTIV Epoc headset. We use its gyroscope to drive the view on flat screens projections. The visuals and sounds of the scene are matched to alpha, beta and theta power, as well as trained parameters from  OpenViBE. The result is an abstract audiovisual experience which you can shape to your liking with your mind only!
