## WHAT

B-vr [biːvə(r)] is a virtual reality visual music instrument controlled by the brain. Using the EMOTIV Epoc headset we extract certain features of the EEG signal of a subject and use these to affect various aspects of the virtual environment. The external environment is thus at once reflecting and affecting the internal state of the subject.

## WHY
